# Solar-Powered Fleet Tracking System
A self-powered GPS tracking system ideal for deployment in rural areas. It attaches to any sun-exposed vehicle and relays the vehicleâ€™s GPS location (latitude and longitude) in real-time to a central node, which displays the location on an interactive map. The project involves a star network of two roaming nodes that communicate with a central home node. The roaming nodes are self-powered by solar energy and communicate through LoRa (long range) modulation. A media access control (MAC) protocol that uses channel activity detection (CAD) and exponential back-off ensures that all nodes communicate without interference. This project joins many other self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) applications at the forefront of recent research and commercial products.  
## System Overview

Three PCBs were made, two for the roaming nodes and one home node. The roaming node could be reconfigured to be a home node. The roaming node layout is seen below.
